## AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template


This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Component-Based Design**: Refactored homepage leveraging reusable components such as `Header`, `Footer`, `ProfileCard`, `Message`, and `Button` for better maintainability.

## Homepage Refactor

The homepage has been refactored to improve user experience and code maintainability. The following components are now utilized:

- `Header`
- `Footer`
- `ProfileCard`
- `Message`
- `Button`

## Testing

Additional tests have been created to cover new components and features. Run tests using:

```

Ensure all new components and the refactored homepage are covered with unit and integration tests.
